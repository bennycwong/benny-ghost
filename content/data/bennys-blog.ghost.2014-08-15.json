Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

We have a million distractions and find it hard to gather the will power to just get something started.\n\nIn my journey to solving this problem for myself, I've come up with a few strategies that have helped. Here's the first one.\n\nOne helpful quote to remember to give you the best chance against procrastination. Are you ready for this?\n\n\n>You snooze you lose.\n> \n<br>\n\nYes, this what someone says to you when your indecisiveness lets an opportunity slip right through your fingertips. Don't you just want to give them a high five... in the face... with a folding chair?\n\nPutting the chair aside, I'm here to suggest that you can use this quote in an entirely different way:\n\n***If you are fighting the battle of procrastination, hitting the snooze button is the first step towards failure.***\n\n<br>\nIf you think about it, the snooze button is the simplest form of procrastination. When I set the alarm clock, I'm telling myself that I'll wake up at a certain time. I'm making that committment to start my day at that time. When I hit the snooze button, I'm basically **procrastinating** on my day.\n\nWhy does this first act of procrastination matter? Because of **momentum**. How many times do you hit the snooze button? If you were to give an honest answer, probably more than once. I don't know anyone that just hits the snooze button once. I hit it again and again and again...\n\n![Snooze](http://veryhilarious.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/snooze-button.jpg)\n<br>\nLikewise, when I go to the gym every day in a week, I feel good and want to keep going. On the flipside, if I start skipping workouts, it makes it so much easier to skip the next day, and the next day, and so on. The main goal of this strategy **is to get the productive ball rolling as soon as possible, and not the ball we don't want: Procrastination**.\n\nIf the first action of my day is to procrastinate, I'm much more likely to continue to procrastinate the rest of the day. If my first action of the day is to get up and take the first step towards my day, I've won a small battle and started building momentum towards productivity for the rest of the day.\n<br><br>\n\n###In Practice\nPutting this into practice, I've noticed an improvement in my productivity throughout the day. I'm more motivated to get things done. In fact, it helped me get this blog post out. It was the jump start/kick in the pants that I needed.\n\nSo if you, like me, am a snoozer, try ditching the snooze button for a week. See if it makes a difference. What do you have to lose, besides a few minutes of feeling horrible about yourself?\n\n______\nWhy should you listen to me? You shouldn't. I don't know if this is going to work for you. This is just what's worked for me. Go and try it for yourself. See if it works. If it does, great. If not, try something else. All I want is to share what worked for me and to help you make changes that'll make a difference, even if it's a small one.\n\n<br><br>\n\nDid this tactic work for you? Leave a comment below and share your story.\n","html":"<p><img src=\"http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Technology/gty_extra_sleep_end_daylight_savings_ll_111020_wg.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p>The number one problem that many of us struggle with today is time management and procrastination. We have a million distractions and find it hard to gather the will power to just get something started.</p>\n\n<p>In my journey to solving this problem for myself, I've come up with a few strategies that have helped. Here's the first one.</p>\n\n<p>One helpful quote to remember to give you the best chance against procrastination. Are you ready for this?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You snooze you lose.</p>\n  \n  <p><br></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, this what someone says to you when your indecisiveness lets an opportunity slip right through your fingertips. Don't you just want to give them a high five... in the face... with a folding chair?</p>\n\n<p>Putting the chair aside, I'm here to suggest that you can use this quote in an entirely different way:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>If you are fighting the battle of procrastination, hitting the snooze button is the first step towards failure.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><br> <br />\nIf you think about it, the snooze button is the simplest form of procrastination. When I set the alarm clock, I'm telling myself that I'll wake up at a certain time. I'm making that committment to start my day at that time. When I hit the snooze button, I'm basically <strong>procrastinating</strong> on my day.</p>\n\n<p>Why does this first act of procrastination matter? Because of <strong>momentum</strong>. How many times do you hit the snooze button? If you were to give an honest answer, probably more than once. I don't know anyone that just hits the snooze button once. I hit it again and again and again...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://veryhilarious.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/snooze-button.jpg\" alt=\"Snooze\" />\n<br> <br />\nLikewise, when I go to the gym every day in a week, I feel good and want to keep going. On the flipside, if I start skipping workouts, it makes it so much easier to skip the next day, and the next day, and so on. The main goal of this strategy <strong>is to get the productive ball rolling as soon as possible, and not the ball we don't want: Procrastination</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If the first action of my day is to procrastinate, I'm much more likely to continue to procrastinate the rest of the day. If my first action of the day is to get up and take the first step towards my day, I've won a small battle and started building momentum towards productivity for the rest of the day. <br />\n<br><br></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"inpractice\">In Practice</h3>\n\n<p>Putting this into practice, I've noticed an improvement in my productivity throughout the day. I'm more motivated to get things done. In fact, it helped me get this blog post out. It was the jump start/kick in the pants that I needed.</p>\n\n<p>So if you, like me, am a snoozer, try ditching the snooze button for a week. See if it makes a difference. What do you have to lose, besides a few minutes of feeling horrible about yourself?</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Why should you listen to me? You shouldn't. I don't know if this is going to work for you. This is just what's worked for me. Go and try it for yourself. See if it works. If it does, great. If not, try something else. All I want is to share what worked for me and to help you make changes that'll make a difference, even if it's a small one.</p>\n\n<p><br><br></p>\n\n<p>Did this tactic work for you?

It's my go to source to buy used products for a fraction of the original price. Sometimes I find such a good deal that I can turn around it sell the exact same item for more money than I paid. A few years ago, I bought a [Rickenbacker 4001](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickenbacker_4001) Bass from someone for $1000. I turned around and sold it for $1300 in 1 week later. **That's a 30% return on investment in 1 week**. BOOYAH.\n\n![Rickenbacker 4001](http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j155/sunburstlp/1970s/1973%20Rickenbacker%204001/1973Rickenbacker4001Azureglo032.jpg) \n\nIf you want to win at the game of craigslist (winning means you get a deal when buying and the best price when selling), you have to be less desperate than the other party. \n\nBut that's another topic of discussion. Let's talk about something else... \n\n<br><br>\n\n###Effective lowballing\n\nI want to share a story with you about how a woman would have successfully lowballed me, if I needed to sell an item right away and wasn't already entertaining another offer. Heck, I was so impressed with this e-mail, I might actually accept this offer just to meet this woman and congratulate her on writing this amazing email. I bet she uses this as a template.\n\nSo last year, I started a business that livestreams weddings. I bought a Panasonic GH2 with some other necessary gear and shot 3 weddings. My thought was that I would quickly build this business to test the market. At the start of this year, I decided that this business just isn't viable. But that's also for for another post. I tell you this just so you would know that I had some camera gear to sell, so I go to my favorite website: Craigslist. I'll even include the URL to the page while it's still up:\n\nhttp://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/pho/4499438251.html\n\n<a href=http://www.webpagescreenshot.info/img/5390e3dd3175c9-71343468><img src=http://www.webpagescreenshot.info/i3/5390e3dd3175c9-71343468></a>\n\n\nI generally start off by listing the item for sale using basic language and set a price higher than I'd accept, that way I have some room for people to neogiate. If it doesn't sell after a while, I'll update the wording on my post to make it more appealling or lower the price. It's pretty standard practice. **What's also normal is getting a lot of people who lowball you.** Generally, people put zero thought into a lowball email\n\nHere's one that I got for the camera I'm selling:\n\n>Hi, I'm interested in this camera, will you do $200?\n\nUmm, no. I will not. It's not worth my time to even respond to these people with a no. However, today I got what is the best lowball e-mail I have ever received.\n\n<br>\n###Carol's Email\n\n>Good Afternoon! I came across your camera for sale today. We've been looking for a starter camera to get our documentary on the corruption in Brazil going and I must say your camera looks good.\n\n>There's no doubt your camera is worth $495, as you mentioned your camera is in mint condition . I honestly don't expect you to budge on your price at all but I had to contact you. Our budget is only $300 but I've talked my husband into spending $400 after seeing your camera for sale.\n\n>My husband will be in Santa Monica for the day. He can pay you cash today if that works for you.\n\n>Thank you for your consideration and have an awesome day!\n\n>Carol\n\n    \n<br>\n\nIf I were a desperate seller who was trying to sell my camera, would I sell it to Carol or the random thoughtless I'll throw you an offer guy? Even if that guy offered me more than Carol, I would still rather sell it to Carol.\n\nI'm definately adapting Carol's strategy of lowball on Craigslist in the future.\n\n\n<br>\n\n###Let's break down why \n\nThere are 4 reasons why I would sell to Carol if I was going to lowball:\n\n####1. She appealed to my sense of morality.\n\nGenerally, when you're buying something, you don't want to reveal why you want it, especially if you're desperate to use it. For example, if you say that you need it this weekend to complete a project, you're showing that solving the problem of needing a camera is much more important than the money. This signals to the seller than you are desperate, and thus the price will not budge. \n\n\n>Good Afternoon! I came across your camera for ale today. We've been looking for a starter camera to get our documentary on the corruption in Brazil going and I must say your camera looks good.\n\n\n\nHowever, in this scenario, Carol makes an appeal to my sense of morality. She introduced her story and gave me a reason to care about her story. Who doesn't want to help bring corruption to light? Who likes corruption?\n\nShe gave me a reason to sell her the camera.\n\n####2. She acknowledges that my price is fair and that she's doing everything she can to come close.\n\n\nThe first rule of effective negotiation is to not piss off the other party. You want them to feel like an ally, not an advesary. Typically, in these scenarios, you'll some form of the following:\n\n>I like your XYZ but your price is ridiculous. How bout XYZ dollars.\n\nBy saying that my price is too high, the buyer already made him an advesary. How dare he say that my price is ridiculous? \n\nHere's what Carol said instead:\n\n\n>There's no doubt your camera is worth $495, as you mentioned your camera is in mint condition. I honestly don't expect you to budge on your price at all but I had to contact you.\n\nWow. That's refreshing. She acknowledges that my price is fair (feeding my ego) and made me feel good. \n\n>Our budget is only $300 but I've talked my husband into spending $400 after seeing your camera for sale.\n\nNext, Carol whips out a story on how her budget is only $300. However, she was able to talk her husband up to $400. What she did here was to put herself on the same side as me. She created a common enemy (her budget) and joined my side by convincing her husband to go up to $400. Whether this story is true or not doesn't matter. She put herself on the same team as me against a common enemy.\n\n####3. She put references to my post in her email to show that she did read it.\n\nA lot of times, people just don't read on Craigslist. I list all my items clearly stating that they're in Santa Monica. If I had a quarter for every time a buyer asks where I am located, I'd have a couple hundred dollars. That's not to mention the hundreds of times someone would ask what's included when I list on the ad what's included. \n\n\n>My husband will be in Santa Monica for the day.\n\n\nCarol, on the other hand, masterfully included my location in her email, which signaled to me that she read my post. This means she'll be far easier to work with when setting up a time to meet. It was a very simple statement, but hit all the marks of someone who actually read the ad, and thus won't waste my time.\n\n\n\n####4. She did the work for me by setting an expectation on when we can meet.\n\nWhen selling things on craigslist, the faster the sale, the better.\n\nOne of the most annoying parts of craigslist is schedulig a time to meet. There are a lot of back and forth e-mails and it's hard to work out. \n\n\n>My husband will be in Santa Monica for the day. He can pay you cash today if that works for you.\n\n>Thank you for your consideration and have an awesome day!\"\n\nCarol tells me that if I want, we can make this happen today. Her husband will be in Santa Monica and that they will be paying cash. She takes away the guess work and sets the expectation. This is a cash deal and it can happen today. If I were to accept the deal, I can expect very little back and forth and less time wasted on my part.\n\n\n\n<br>\n###The Takeaway\n\nAfter writing this blog post, I can confidently say that Carol is a student of the psychology of sales. This email stands out and she knows it. I actually want to sell this camera to her, just so I can write about the rest of the experience and chat with her about the psychology of sales. \n\nCraigslist isn't usually this much fun!\n\n\n<br>\n###BONUS SECTION###\nFor your future lowballing needs, I've whipped up a **Craigslist Lowballing Template** for your lowballing needs based on Carol's email, but with minor improvements.\n\n\tHello,\n\n\t[INSERT GREETING]. I came across your [NAME OF ITEM FOR SALE -- ex: Panasonic GH2] for sale today. \n\n\t[OPTIONAL SECTION -- if you have a good reason]\n    \n\tI've been looking for [GENERAL NAME OF ITEM] to [GOOD REASON FOR NEEDING THE ITEM]\n\n\tThere's no doubt your [ITEM] is worth [LISTED PRICE], as you mentioned your [ITEM] is [REASON WHY IT'S FAIR. MENTION SOMETHING IN THE AD TO SHOW YOU'VE READ IT]. I honestly don't expect you to budge on your price at all but I had to contact you. Our budget is only [INSERT REALL LOW BALL AMOUNT] but I've talked my [COMMON ENEMY] into spending [ACTUAL OFFER PRICE] after seeing your [ITEM] for sale.\n\n\tI will be in [LOCATION OF ITEM] for the day.

Even if that guy offered me more than Carol, I would still rather sell it to Carol.</p>\n\n<p>I'm definately adapting Carol's strategy of lowball on Craigslist in the future.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"letsbreakdownwhy\">Let's break down why</h3>\n\n<p>There are 4 reasons why I would sell to Carol if I was going to lowball:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"1sheappealedtomysenseofmorality\">1. She appealed to my sense of morality.</h4>\n\n<p>Generally, when you're buying something, you don't want to reveal why you want it, especially if you're desperate to use it. For example, if you say that you need it this weekend to complete a project, you're showing that solving the problem of needing a camera is much more important than the money. This signals to the seller than you are desperate, and thus the price will not budge. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Good Afternoon! I came across your camera for ale today. We've been looking for a starter camera to get our documentary on the corruption in Brazil going and I must say your camera looks good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in this scenario, Carol makes an appeal to my sense of morality. She introduced her story and gave me a reason to care about her story. Who doesn't want to help bring corruption to light? Who likes corruption?</p>\n\n<p>She gave me a reason to sell her the camera.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"2sheacknowledgesthatmypriceisfairandthatshesdoingeverythingshecantocomeclose\">2. She acknowledges that my price is fair and that she's doing everything she can to come close.</h4>\n\n<p>The first rule of effective negotiation is to not piss off the other party. You want them to feel like an ally, not an advesary. Typically, in these scenarios, you'll some form of the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I like your XYZ but your price is ridiculous. How bout XYZ dollars.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By saying that my price is too high, the buyer already made him an advesary. How dare he say that my price is ridiculous? </p>\n\n<p>Here's what Carol said instead:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There's no doubt your camera is worth $495, as you mentioned your camera is in mint condition. I honestly don't expect you to budge on your price at all but I had to contact you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow. That's refreshing. She acknowledges that my price is fair (feeding my ego) and made me feel good. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our budget is only $300 but I've talked my husband into spending $400 after seeing your camera for sale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Next, Carol whips out a story on how her budget is only $300. However, she was able to talk her husband up to $400. What she did here was to put herself on the same side as me. She created a common enemy (her budget) and joined my side by convincing her husband to go up to $400. Whether this story is true or not doesn't matter. She put herself on the same team as me against a common enemy.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3sheputreferencestomypostinheremailtoshowthatshedidreadit\">3. She put references to my post in her email to show that she did read it.</h4>\n\n<p>A lot of times, people just don't read on Craigslist. I list all my items clearly stating that they're in Santa Monica. If I had a quarter for every time a buyer asks where I am located, I'd have a couple hundred dollars. That's not to mention the hundreds of times someone would ask what's included when I list on the ad what's included. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My husband will be in Santa Monica for the day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Carol, on the other hand, masterfully included my location in her email, which signaled to me that she read my post. This means she'll be far easier to work with when setting up a time to meet. It was a very simple statement, but hit all the marks of someone who actually read the ad, and thus won't waste my time.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"4shedidtheworkformebysettinganexpectationonwhenwecanmeet\">4. She did the work for me by setting an expectation on when we can meet.</h4>\n\n<p>When selling things on craigslist, the faster the sale, the better.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most annoying parts of craigslist is schedulig a time to meet. There are a lot of back and forth e-mails and it's hard to work out. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My husband will be in Santa Monica for the day. He can pay you cash today if that works for you.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thank you for your consideration and have an awesome day!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Carol tells me that if I want, we can make this happen today. Her husband will be in Santa Monica and that they will be paying cash. She takes away the guess work and sets the expectation. This is a cash deal and it can happen today. If I were to accept the deal, I can expect very little back and forth and less time wasted on my part.</p>\n\n<p><br>  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thetakeaway\">The Takeaway</h3>\n\n<p>After writing this blog post, I can confidently say that Carol is a student of the psychology of sales. This email stands out and she knows it. I actually want to sell this camera to her, just so I can write about the rest of the experience and chat with her about the psychology of sales. </p>\n\n<p>Craigslist isn't usually this much fun!</p>\n\n<p><br>  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bonussection\">BONUS SECTION</h3>\n\n<p>For your future lowballing needs, I've whipped up a <strong>Craigslist Lowballing Template</strong> for your lowballing needs based on Carol's email, but with minor improvements.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Hello,\n\n[INSERT GREETING]. I came across your [NAME OF ITEM FOR SALE -- ex: Panasonic GH2] for sale today. \n\n[OPTIONAL SECTION -- if you have a good reason]\n\nI've been looking for [GENERAL NAME OF ITEM] to [GOOD REASON FOR NEEDING THE ITEM]\n\nThere's no doubt your [ITEM] is worth [LISTED PRICE], as you mentioned your [ITEM] is [REASON WHY IT'S FAIR. MENTION SOMETHING IN THE AD TO SHOW YOU'VE READ IT]. I honestly don't expect you to budge on your price at all but I had to contact you.

The thing that gets personal finance bloggers up in the morning. Albert Einstein [supposedly](http://www.snopes.com/quotes/einstein/interest.asp) declared compound interest \"the most powerful force in the universe.\"\n\nFor those who don't know, [compound interest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) is when interest is added to the principal of a deposit or loan, so that, from that moment on, the interest that has been added also earns interest. \n\n This is a very important principle in the world of investing.\n<br>\n\n###When Benny Met Compound Interest\n\nBack in junior high, my teacher the following question:\n>If you could choose between 1 million dollars or 1 cent that was doubled everyday for the next 31 days, which would you rather have?\n\nOf course, like most of the students in the class, I assumed that 1 million was the better option without giving it a second thought. You might have thought that a clever kid like myself would've figured out that this kind of question is meant to trick you...\n\nIf you do the math, at day 27, you would have \n**$1,342,177.28**. A full 31 days would result in \n**$10,737,418.24**.\n\nThat's to show that when you are working with multipliers, the compound effects over time is ridiculously large.\n\nOf course, doubling your money even every year is ridiculously difficult.\n\nThat leads me to my second story, my first accounting class in college.\n\n###Accounting 1A\n*Don't quote me on the class number. I think that was the class number.\n\nIt was winter quarter at UCLA. It was the first day of my accounting class. Our professor, a middle aged blonde lady, clearly loved money. She joking called her children her precious tax deductions. \n\nIn order to get our attention and to make us like her, she showed us the secret of becoming a millionaire. The secret is... you guessed it: **compound interest.**\n\nAs her first lesson, she showed us a slide that showed that at a measely **5.4% interest rate**, an 18 year old who started a Roth IRA and put away $5000 per year every until retirement at 65 will end up with **$1,004,100.12**. What if the interest rate went up to **8%**? **$2,264,500.76.** \n\nWhat does this have to do with accounting? Not much, but it got our interest in the class.\n\nHer point: start saving for retirement early. The earlier, the better.\n\nThat's very good advice. The longer you let interest accumlate, the more you end up with.\n<br>\n\n###What If...\nIf you know anything about finance, that's all old news. Compound interest is indeed a powerful force.\n\nWhat if we looked at the compounding effect another way?\n\nWhat if we try to learn something new or get better at something every single day?\n\n>learn something new or get better at something every single day\n\nWe do it with money. Why not do it with our own life? Learn something everyday and put it into practice. \n\nIt makes sense that if we make small improvements everyday, a year from now, we'll would have made a lot of improvements. Assume that we improve by **1%** every day, by the end of the year, we would have made **3,678.34%** difference in our lives. \n\n\n\n<br>\n____\n<br>\n\n\n###Resources for improvement\nHere are some resources for personal development:\n\n###Personal Finance/Investing\n####Early Retirement/Financial Independence\n1.

The secret is... you guessed it: <strong>compound interest.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As her first lesson, she showed us a slide that showed that at a measely <strong>5.4% interest rate</strong>, an 18 year old who started a Roth IRA and put away $5000 per year every until retirement at 65 will end up with <strong>$1,004,100.12</strong>. What if the interest rate went up to <strong>8%</strong>? <strong>$2,264,500.76.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>What does this have to do with accounting? Not much, but it got our interest in the class.</p>\n\n<p>Her point: start saving for retirement early. The earlier, the better.</p>\n\n<p>That's very good advice. The longer you let interest accumlate, the more you end up with. <br />\n<br></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatif\">What If...</h3>\n\n<p>If you know anything about finance, that's all old news. Compound interest is indeed a powerful force.</p>\n\n<p>What if we looked at the compounding effect another way?</p>\n\n<p>What if we try to learn something new or get better at something every single day?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>learn something new or get better at something every single day</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We do it with money. Why not do it with our own life? Learn something everyday and put it into practice. </p>\n\n<p>It makes sense that if we make small improvements everyday, a year from now, we'll would have made a lot of improvements. Assume that we improve by <strong>1%</strong> every day, by the end of the year, we would have made <strong>3,678.34%</strong> difference in our lives. </p>\n\n<p><br>  </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"resourcesforimprovement\">Resources for improvement</h3>\n\n<p>Here are some resources for personal development:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personalfinanceinvesting\">Personal Finance/Investing</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"earlyretirementfinancialindependence\">Early Retirement/Financial Independence</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Mr Money Moustache <br />\n<a href='http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/'>http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Reddit subreddit: /r/financialindependence/ <br />\n<a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/'>http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The Millionaire Next Door <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Thomas-Stanley-Ph-D-ebook/dp/B00CLT31D6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402365053&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=millionaire+next+door\">http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Thomas-Stanley-Ph-D-ebook/dp/B00CLT31D6/ref=sr<em>1</em>1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402365053&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=millionaire+next+door</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"equities\">Equities</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402364900&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=intelligent+investor\">http://www.amazon.com/The-Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing/dp/0060555661/ref=sr<em>1</em>1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402364900&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=intelligent+investor</a></p></li>\n<li><p>A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/0393340740/ref=pd_sim_b_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0AFYSDX1QRE2RB79YVH8\">http://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/0393340740/ref=pd<em>sim</em>b_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0AFYSDX1QRE2RB79YVH8</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"realestate\">Real Estate</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Biggerpockets.com <br />\n<a href='http://www.biggerpockets.com/'>http://www.biggerpockets.com/</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Jason Hartman <br />\n<a href='http://www.jasonhartman.com/'>http://www.jasonhartman.com/</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships\">Relationships</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034\">http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"productivity\">Productivity</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Power of Full Engagement <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Power-Full-Engagement-Managing-Performance-ebook/dp/B000FC0SWS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402422431&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+full+engagement\">http://www.amazon.com/Power-Full-Engagement-Managing-Performance-ebook/dp/B000FC0SWS/ref=sr<em>1</em>1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402422431&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+full+engagement</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=pd_sim_b_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1RSGCTF0SGZ8B09HB21B\">http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=pd<em>sim</em>b_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1RSGCTF0SGZ8B09HB21B</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/1451639619/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1RSGCTF0SGZ8B09HB21B\">http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/1451639619/ref=pd<em>sim</em>b_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1RSGCTF0SGZ8B09HB21B</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"learning\">Learning</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Chef-Cooking-Learning-Anything-ebook/dp/B005NJU8PA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402422522&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+chef\">http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Chef-Cooking-Learning-Anything-ebook/dp/B005NJU8PA/ref=sr<em>1</em>1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402422522&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+chef</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything . . .

Naturally, a big part of that is writing good code.<a href=\"#notes-1\">*</a>\n\nTo understand how to write good code, one must understand what bad code is. \n\n**So what the heck does bad code mean?**\nThat's something I've pondered for some time and will continue to ponder. (Sounds kind of like a [perfect tense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)) in Ancient Greek)\n\nI tend to find it helpful to use an analogies as a means of communicating ideas. I like cars, so I'm going to use cars as an analogy.\n\nSo what is a bad car? You'll get all sorts of answers. You'll have people who think Toyotas are the greatest, and others who hate them and will and never drive one.\n\nIf that sounds kind of **subjective**, it is... sort of. The subjective part is what a person value in a car. Holding for those criteria, majority of people will agree on what is a good car and what is a bad car. <br><br>\n\n\n###4 kinds of bad cars\n####1. The Unreliable Car\n\n<img src=\"http://ultrait.me/images/Content/e2a6c4bb-4.jpg\">\nFor most people, this is their greatest fear: a car that leaves them stranded on the side of the road. This car doesn't always start. It doesn't matter how nice and luxurious the car is, any long germ relationship with this car will probably be an unpleasant experience. Just ask any Land Rover owners.\n\n\n**The Bad Code** version of this is code that works sometimes and doesn't work other times. Your program didn't handle the cases properly, so what you thought would work doesn't. Typically this occurs at the edge cases and with null objects. Writing good tests are a good first step to solving this problem.\n\n####2. The Lower Performance Car\n<img src=\"http://www.gavinshoebridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gas-guzzler.jpg\">\nThere are two main types of ideals in terms of performance:\n\n**Regular People Version - The Gas Guzzler:** The lower the MPGs, the worse the car is. These cars are big, bulky, and use up a lot of gas, and the dollars in your wallet. A lot of people are getting rid of their \"bad\" gas guzzlers to get more efficient \"good\" cars like the Toyota Prius. \n\n**Car guy version - The slow/poor handling car:** Speaking of the Toyota Prius, this the car that \"car people\" love to hate. It's got the 0-60 of a turtle, body roll like a boat, and feels as lively as a corpse. It will get you where you want to go... slowly.\n\n**The Bad Code** version of this kind is code that's inefficient in memory usage or process. It's the O(n^2) / O(2^n) / O(n!) algorithms. Writing one of these will make a computer sciencist either mock or feel sorry for you.\n\n####3. The overly-complex, hard-to-repair car\nEvery kind of car will have at least an occasional problem. Even \"bulletproof\" Toyotas and Hondas. Even if they don't break down, someone could crash into you... or you might crash into someone/something.\n\nMost people will probably not care about this, but your mechanic certainly does. Ask a SAE certified mechanic what they think are bad cars and they'll probably say that Volkswagens/Audis are some of the worse cars on the road. Sure, you'll look good in one and they ride nice, but they were not built with repairs in mind.<a href=\"#notes-2\">\\*\\*</a> \n\n\nTypically, a car that's considered hard to work on are cars that package everything too tightly (big engine small car), use non standard screws/bolt sizes, requires special tools, use non readily available parts, etc. \n\n<img src=\"http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--bf6oIHNN--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18to9clmwisakjpg.jpg\">\n\n\nI think a great example of a difficult car to maintain is the **2003 Audi RS6**. By a lot of measures, it's a great car. It shocked the world when it debuted, and it's on the Jalopnik's watchlist as a [potential future classic](http://jalopnik.com/why-the-audi-rs6-is-a-future-classic-759640980).\n\nHere's why it's bad. Changing the o2 sensor ($50 dollar part) is a rather trivial task on most cars, taking maybe an hour if you're unfamiliar with the car. However, on the 2003 Audi RS6, it requires [removing the engine and the transmission](http://www.rs6.com/showthread.php/19265-Replacing-RS6-EGT-sensor). Audi shops charge 20hrs of labor to do something that should take less than 1 hour to do for most other cars!\n\nThere's another reason why some cars are hard to repair: they have really obscure parts that are not shared among many others. This makes them expensive to manufacture and hard to find. This is why certain supercars will sit in the shop for months, waiting for the right part to arrive.\n\n**The Bad Code Version**:\nSo what does this have to do with bad code, and why is this section longer than the rest?\n\nI think in this software world, bad code mostly refers to **code that is hard to maintain**. Getting a program to work is not trivial, but debugging code is probably what developers spend a huge chunk of time doing.\n\nCode that is overly complex, hard to understand, contains too many conditionals or nested loops fall into this category. Sure the code works, but maintaining this is a pain in the butt.\n\nThe problem is that when code is hard to understand, it takes a lot of effort to try to figure out what the code is doing. Since our ability to solve problems is a finite resource (a blog post on this is to come), we would waste our resource trying to decipher code instead of actually using it to come up with solutions to bugs and defects.\n\nAnother aspect of bad code is really obscure packages/gems/references/unusual patterns that no one understands or is not well known in the world. I'm not saying it's always bad to use these, but the more obscure the code is, the fewer people will know about it and understand how it works, thus your chance of getting help is fewer.\n\nThere's a famous saying in the programming world from an unknown source: \n\n>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.\n\nAnd yes, you are that violent psychopath, and I'm pretty sure you know where you live.\n\nHow important is this point? If you are not a mechanic or don't work on your own car, then having a car that's hard to fix is not a big deal, since it's not something that happens too frequently.\n\nHowever, in software development, one is always tinkering \"under-the-hood.\"\n\nImagine a car that is constantly being worked on to refine, and it needs to be worked on by a lot of people who might not know anything about this specific kind of car (but have a general knowledge of how cars work). If you lay out your oil filter, screws/bolts, etc in a logical way, working on the car becomes a joy.\n\nThink of your car and how you use it. You just get in and go. Now think think about how everytime you want to use it, you have to change the oil, change the wheels, change the air filter, unbolt the doors, and change the brake pads.\n\nA software engineer spends a lot of time \"under-the-hood\". Working with code that is easy to understand is simply a joy, and every time an engineer works with code that's hard to understand, a kitten dies.\n\n\n####4. The car that doesn't do what you need.\n\nFinally, there's the car that doesn't fit your needs. If you have a family of 5, a 2 seater sports car isn't going to cut it, and it's a bad car for you. If you are a contractor, a family sedan's not going to cut it. \n\n\n<img src=\"http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--pxR9_uFo--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18n7wlajt921cjpg.jpg\">\n\nOf course, there's always a bozo out there who'll haul stuff with their track car, but you can bet a Ford F-150 is much better for that job.\n\n\n\n**The Bad Code Version:**\nThis is the simplest and the hardest all the kinds of bad code. It's code that doesn't solve your user's problems. To non technical people, this is pretty much the only thing that matters. It doesn't matter if your code is faster than a speeding bullet, more reliable than a doorstop, and cleaner than Mary Poppin's apartment... if no one wants to use your code.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n##The Attributes of Good Code\n\n\nAnother way to think of this is to turn the types of bad cars into different dimensions (attributes) to rate the quality of code. \n\n\n\n1. Reliability \n-- Does it work cosistently?\n<br>-- Have I tested various edge cases and null objects?\n\n2. Efficiency \n-- Does this program do or store unecessary things?\n<br>-- Are there ways to make it use less memory/less processes\n\n3. Repairability \n-- How easy is it to understand what my program is doing?\n<Br>-- If I had to look at this in 6 months, will I want to go back in time and punch myself in the face?\n\n4. Suitability \n-- Does this solve the user's problems? \n<br>-- Am I writing the right program\n\n<Br>\n<Br>\n###Final note\n\nIn the case of cars, I can't think of a single case where it's not bad in at least one way.\n\nLikewise, while it's possible to have all of these attributes in software, it's unlikely that one project will have world class at all of these. The engineering question is: know what's important to your project. \n\nThere are often trade offs that you'll have to make. For example, an recursive algorithm (bad) is often times much more elegant and readable. If you are not working through a huge dataset, the performance gains might not be relevant.\n\nPart of being a good software engineer is knowning when to optimize for performance and when to optimize for easy understanding and debugging. \n\nFinally, as a word of encouragement to those who've written a lot of bad code in the past:\n\nThe reality is, we all start off as bad programmers. The more we are exposed to code (our own and other people's), the more we learn about each factor of good code. Eventually, we'll start writing less bad code, then okay code, then decent code, then good code, and maybe someday we can even write good code.\n\nFor those who are just starting out, just write code and get other people to look at it. It'll suck. It'll be hard to understand, and you'll feel like you suck. But remember:\n<img src=\"http://www.quickmeme.com/img/87/8797266167c34c67372ab7887cfdea2a303f2ef6c554a47607689e1232a3f9da.jpg\">\n\nEven with programs of mild complexity, there is always room for improvement. Unlike cars, we can change our design and implementations with just a keyboard. A bad car (using whichever criteria you choose) will always be a bad car. A bad codebase doesn't have to stay that way. **Refactor on!**\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n___\n\n\n<span id=\"notes-1\">\\**There are a lot of other things that makes one an excellent software professional, but I'll focus on hard skills today.*</span>\n\n\n<span id=\"notes-2\">*\\*\\*One could argue that the complexity of the cars is a feature, not a bug, because it will cost more labor hours to repair, thus making more money for the dealers.*</span>\n\n\nDo you agree?

I'd love to hear what you think and how I can continuet to improve my understanding of what is good or bad code.\n\n\n\n","html":"<h3 id=\"goodcodebadcode\">Good Code Bad Code</h3>\n\n<p>As a software developer, I strive to be excellent at my craft. Naturally, a big part of that is writing good code.<a href=\"#notes-1\">*</a></p>\n\n<p>To understand how to write good code, one must understand what bad code is. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So what the heck does bad code mean?</strong>\nThat's something I've pondered for some time and will continue to ponder. (Sounds kind of like a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)\">perfect tense</a> in Ancient Greek)</p>\n\n<p>I tend to find it helpful to use an analogies as a means of communicating ideas. I like cars, so I'm going to use cars as an analogy.</p>\n\n<p>So what is a bad car? You'll get all sorts of answers. You'll have people who think Toyotas are the greatest, and others who hate them and will and never drive one.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds kind of <strong>subjective</strong>, it is... sort of. The subjective part is what a person value in a car. Holding for those criteria, majority of people will agree on what is a good car and what is a bad car. <br><br></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4kindsofbadcars\">4 kinds of bad cars</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"1theunreliablecar\">1. The Unreliable Car</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ultrait.me/images/Content/e2a6c4bb-4.jpg\"> <br />\nFor most people, this is their greatest fear: a car that leaves them stranded on the side of the road. This car doesn't always start. It doesn't matter how nice and luxurious the car is, any long germ relationship with this car will probably be an unpleasant experience. Just ask any Land Rover owners.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Bad Code</strong> version of this is code that works sometimes and doesn't work other times. Your program didn't handle the cases properly, so what you thought would work doesn't. Typically this occurs at the edge cases and with null objects. Writing good tests are a good first step to solving this problem.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"2thelowerperformancecar\">2. The Lower Performance Car</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.gavinshoebridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gas-guzzler.jpg\"> <br />\nThere are two main types of ideals in terms of performance:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regular People Version - The Gas Guzzler:</strong> The lower the MPGs, the worse the car is. These cars are big, bulky, and use up a lot of gas, and the dollars in your wallet. A lot of people are getting rid of their \"bad\" gas guzzlers to get more efficient \"good\" cars like the Toyota Prius. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Car guy version - The slow/poor handling car:</strong> Speaking of the Toyota Prius, this the car that \"car people\" love to hate. It's got the 0-60 of a turtle, body roll like a boat, and feels as lively as a corpse. It will get you where you want to go... slowly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Bad Code</strong> version of this kind is code that's inefficient in memory usage or process. It's the O(n^2) / O(2^n) / O(n!) algorithms. Writing one of these will make a computer sciencist either mock or feel sorry for you.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3theoverlycomplexhardtorepaircar\">3. The overly-complex, hard-to-repair car</h4>\n\n<p>Every kind of car will have at least an occasional problem. Even \"bulletproof\" Toyotas and Hondas. Even if they don't break down, someone could crash into you... or you might crash into someone/something.</p>\n\n<p>Most people will probably not care about this, but your mechanic certainly does. Ask a SAE certified mechanic what they think are bad cars and they'll probably say that Volkswagens/Audis are some of the worse cars on the road. Sure, you'll look good in one and they ride nice, but they were not built with repairs in mind.<a href=\"#notes-2\">**</a> </p>\n\n<p>Typically, a car that's considered hard to work on are cars that package everything too tightly (big engine small car), use non standard screws/bolt sizes, requires special tools, use non readily available parts, etc. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--bf6oIHNN--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18to9clmwisakjpg.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>I think a great example of a difficult car to maintain is the <strong>2003 Audi RS6</strong>. By a lot of measures, it's a great car. It shocked the world when it debuted, and it's on the Jalopnik's watchlist as a <a href=\"http://jalopnik.com/why-the-audi-rs6-is-a-future-classic-759640980\">potential future classic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here's why it's bad. Changing the o2 sensor ($50 dollar part) is a rather trivial task on most cars, taking maybe an hour if you're unfamiliar with the car. However, on the 2003 Audi RS6, it requires <a href=\"http://www.rs6.com/showthread.php/19265-Replacing-RS6-EGT-sensor\">removing the engine and the transmission</a>. Audi shops charge 20hrs of labor to do something that should take less than 1 hour to do for most other cars!</p>\n\n<p>There's another reason why some cars are hard to repair: they have really obscure parts that are not shared among many others. This makes them expensive to manufacture and hard to find. This is why certain supercars will sit in the shop for months, waiting for the right part to arrive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Bad Code Version</strong>:\nSo what does this have to do with bad code, and why is this section longer than the rest?</p>\n\n<p>I think in this software world, bad code mostly refers to <strong>code that is hard to maintain</strong>. Getting a program to work is not trivial, but debugging code is probably what developers spend a huge chunk of time doing.</p>\n\n<p>Code that is overly complex, hard to understand, contains too many conditionals or nested loops fall into this category. Sure the code works, but maintaining this is a pain in the butt.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that when code is hard to understand, it takes a lot of effort to try to figure out what the code is doing. Since our ability to solve problems is a finite resource (a blog post on this is to come), we would waste our resource trying to decipher code instead of actually using it to come up with solutions to bugs and defects.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of bad code is really obscure packages/gems/references/unusual patterns that no one understands or is not well known in the world. I'm not saying it's always bad to use these, but the more obscure the code is, the fewer people will know about it and understand how it works, thus your chance of getting help is fewer.</p>\n\n<p>There's a famous saying in the programming world from an unknown source: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And yes, you are that violent psychopath, and I'm pretty sure you know where you live.</p>\n\n<p>How important is this point? If you are not a mechanic or don't work on your own car, then having a car that's hard to fix is not a big deal, since it's not something that happens too frequently.</p>\n\n<p>However, in software development, one is always tinkering \"under-the-hood.\"</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a car that is constantly being worked on to refine, and it needs to be worked on by a lot of people who might not know anything about this specific kind of car (but have a general knowledge of how cars work). If you lay out your oil filter, screws/bolts, etc in a logical way, working on the car becomes a joy.</p>\n\n<p>Think of your car and how you use it. You just get in and go. Now think think about how everytime you want to use it, you have to change the oil, change the wheels, change the air filter, unbolt the doors, and change the brake pads.</p>\n\n<p>A software engineer spends a lot of time \"under-the-hood\". Working with code that is easy to understand is simply a joy, and every time an engineer works with code that's hard to understand, a kitten dies.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"4thecarthatdoesntdowhatyouneed\">4. The car that doesn't do what you need.</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, there's the car that doesn't fit your needs. If you have a family of 5, a 2 seater sports car isn't going to cut it, and it's a bad car for you. If you are a contractor, a family sedan's not going to cut it. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--pxR9_uFo--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18n7wlajt921cjpg.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>Of course, there's always a bozo out there who'll haul stuff with their track car, but you can bet a Ford F-150 is much better for that job.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Bad Code Version:</strong>\nThis is the simplest and the hardest all the kinds of bad code.

We've made it to the final round. We were the final 3 out of 10. \n\nAs the final round of this process, we were given access to the codebase of the company we're working on and were given 2 relevant coding assignments (doing real work for the company, not just some random brain teaser). \n\nThis assignment is designed to determine which of the candidates were the best.\n\nAt this point in time, I was interviewing for a Rails development job. At the point of the job interview, my primary experience with development was in Java. I only started learning Rails a week before my interview. \n\nMy competition: Bob (fake name), who has been doing Rails for several years and Bradley (another fake name), who had just finished a 3 month coding school intensive. In terms of experience with Rails, I was the newbie. I was the one at the disadvantage.\n\n<br>\n###The Preperation Advantage\n\nThe night before the interview, we were all given access to the code base so we could familiarize ourselves with the product. I looked through the code and tried running the code to make sure it's setup in my system. That way, I know that it'll work when it comes time to do the assignment. \n\nTurns out, it didn't run just out of the box. It required some setting up. Luckily, the developer who built the product documented the process to get the app working. I took the steps listed and got the app started.\n\nThat's what everyone would do... right?\n\nApprently not. It turns out the Bob and Bradley didn't bother setting up their systems to run the app. When we got to the final interview where this challenge takes place, Bob and Bradley couldn't get the app to start. **Because I came prepared, I had an advantage.** \n\n\n###I turned my advantage into a selling point\n\nSince the other guys was stuck, I had an advantage. It could take them a while to get started, while I would just be happily coding away.\n\nYou say Benny, that's what you did, right?\n\nActually, I took a different approach. I gave away my advantage. Bob and Bradley brought up their issues starting the app, and I showed them kindly how to get it working on their computer.\n\n###What did giving away the advantage do for me?\n\nWhen I realized my advantage, my first thought was to just get started and ignore the other guys. They're my competition. They didn't come prepared and I did. Sucks for them.\n\nBut then I remembered that being a great employee is more than just skill (in this case, how well I code). Soft skills are just as important, if not more important than hard skills. \n\nThe advantage I had was a technical one (I got the application started sooner) and partially a non technical one (I came prepared). But I could announce that I came prepared, but that would sound selfish and prideful. That would not be a good way to win influence.\n\nInstead, I took an opposite approach. I shared my knowledge with my competitors. I helped them setup their machines. I gave away my advantage. I did it in front of the hiring manager.\n\nI gave my advantage away because it signaled a couple things:\n\n**1. Preparedness**\n\nI came prepared. We were given access the day before. I took the time to make sure everything was working so that things would go as smoothly as possible on the day of the competition. As much as it depended on me, I made sure that I was ready. The other guys didn't come prepared to the same degree. \n\n**2. Confidence**\n\nSeriously. Who gives away their secret sauce? Companies spend millions of dollars protecting their secret recipes because it's that valuable to them. Coke's recipe is so secret that even the people who make Coke don't have the complete recipe. They only have what they need to make their part. (Although if you had the recipe to Coke, you still have zero chance of making even a tiny dent to Coke's bottom line, but that's for another discussion). Protecting your secret sauce is worth doing if it's really that special.\n\nIn reality, my secret sauce wasn't really that secret anyways. It would've taken them 5 minutes to figure it out. The advantage I had from being able to start the application earlier is not that big of a deal. But before they can reserach how to get things started, I shared my knowedge with them. By sharing with Bob and Bradley, it shows that I'm not afraid of a little competition. I gave off the message that I'm not afraid of my competition. \n\n\n\n**3. Expertise**\n\nGiving away my advantage was a **competence trigger**, something that signals to others that this person knows their stuff. By being the one to help my competitors setup their systems, I appear as the expert. I'm instantly a level above them, because in this case, Bob and Bradley were the students, and I was the master.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n###The Takeaway\nWhat are some beneath-the-surface you can demonstrate value to the people you interact with? In my case, I looked deeper than the coding skills and demonstrated that I came prepared, that I was confident, and I was an expert. The reality is, the advantage I had was really small. If Bob and Bradley spent 5 minutes looking at the documentaiton, I would not have the advantage. I used a small advantage and used it to communicate much bigger advantage/personal differentiators.\n\nThink about what you are communicating with the words and actions that you take. Those are often much more powerful than the surface level.\n\nP.S. If you ever participate in studies in a university setting, especially if it's a behavioral one, pay attention to what's going on outside of what you're told you're being studied on. Most likely, the researchers are looking at something else that you're doing. If you figure it out, it might be really fun to mess with them.\n","html":"<p>[INSERT STORY ABOUT HOW SUBJECT IS BEING TESTED WHILE NOT REALIZING HE/SHE WAS BEING TESTED]</p>\n\n<p>The point is this: <strong>you are being evaulated for more than just the obvious.</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://31.media.tumblr.com/f2f84305fced9aaea79d4ae709205348/tumblr_mexmldZMjF1qcy3qio1_500.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><br><br>  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"areallifeexample\">A Real Life Example</h3>\n\n<p>I was interviewing for a software development job with 2 other candidates.

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.
